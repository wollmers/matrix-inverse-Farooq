A ... square matrix
a ... element 
n ... dimension

A = [a [i, j]]

The algorithm assumes to take a square matrix A = [a [i, j]], of dimension n. The inverse is
calculated in n iterations.

In each iteration p,
all the existing elements a[i, j], of A change to
new values a_new[i, j],.

After the last iteration i.e.
when p[n] = , a_new[i,j], will be the elements of the
inverse.

d ... determinant of the matrix

 The determinant of the matrix (denoted
by d) is also calculated iteratively through
successive multiplication of the pivot selected
in each iteration. 

In this algorithm the pivots
are selected diagonally starting from a[1, 1],
to a[n, n], .

If any pivot is found to be zero i.e.,
a[p, p] = 0, then inverse cannot be calculated. 

If
an inverse is calculated then d will contain the
determinant of A.

A simple improvement to the algorithm is
to go to the next diagonal element (in case of
zero pivot) and revisit the zero diagonal element
later. Probably by that time it would become
non zero. Note that in step 7 of the following
algorithm a_new[i, p],
' on the LHS means that the latest value of the pivot row is to be used in the
calculations.

Step 1: Let p = 0, d = 1;
Step 2: p <= p +1
Step 3: If a[p, p] == 0 then cannot calculate inverse, go to step 10.
Step 4: d <= d x a[p, p]
Step 5: Calculate the new elements of the pivot row by:
        
  a_new[p,j] <= a[p,j] / a[p,p] where  j = 1 .. n, j != p
  
Step 6: Calculate the new elements of the pivot column by:
        
  a_new[i,p] <= a[i,p] / a[p,p] where  i = 1 .. n, i != p
  
Step 7: Calculate the rest of the new elements by:

  a_new[i,j] <= a[i,j] + a[p,j] x a_new[i,p] where i = 1 .. n, j = 1 .. n, & i,j != p
  
  
Step 8: Calculate the new value of the current pivot location:

  a_new[p,p] <= 1 / a_new[p,p]
  
Step 9: If p < n go to step 2 (n the dimension of the matrix A).

Step 10: Stop. If inverse exists, A contains the inverse and d is the determinant.
